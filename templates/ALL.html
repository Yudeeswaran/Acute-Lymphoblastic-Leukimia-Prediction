            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.</li>
                <li>ALL is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults.</li>
                <li>It is characterized by the overproduction of immature white blood cells called lymphoblasts.</li>
                <li>Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving survival rates.</li>
                <li>Treatment often involves chemotherapy, and may also include radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects lymphoid cells. It is the most common type of cancer in children but can also affect adults.</p>
            <p>In ALL, the bone marrow produces a large number of immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which crowd out normal cells. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, fever, bleeding, and increased risk of infections.</p>
            <p>Early detection and treatment are essential for improving outcomes in individuals with ALL.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia can vary but often include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                <li>Fever and recurrent infections</li>
                <li>Easy bruising or bleeding</li>
                <li>Pain in the bones or joints</li>
                <li>Swollen lymph nodes, liver, or spleen</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Paleness</li>
                <li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to seek medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>There is no known way to prevent acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but certain risk factors can be managed to lower the risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoiding exposure to high doses of radiation and toxic chemicals</li>
                <li>Managing and reducing environmental risk factors</li>
                <li>Ensuring proper medical follow-up for individuals with genetic predispositions or inherited conditions associated with an increased risk of ALL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and regular medical check-ups can also contribute to overall well-being and early detection.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnostic methods for acute lymphoblastic leukemia include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood tests: To check for abnormal levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.</li>
                <li>Bone marrow biopsy: To examine the bone marrow for abnormal cells.</li>
                <li>Imaging tests: Such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs to detect the spread of the disease.</li>
                <li>Genetic tests: To identify specific genetic mutations associated with ALL.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tests help confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Treatment and Care</h2>
            <p>Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia typically involves several phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Induction therapy: The initial phase aimed at achieving remission by killing leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow.</li>
                <li>Consolidation therapy: To eliminate any remaining leukemia cells and prevent relapse.</li>
                <li>Maintenance therapy: Lower doses of chemotherapy over a longer period to maintain remission.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other treatment options may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Targeted therapy: Using drugs that specifically target abnormalities in leukemia cells.</li>
                <li>Radiation therapy: To kill cancer cells or shrink tumors in specific areas of the body.</li>
                <li>Stem cell transplant: Replacing diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells.</li>
                <li>Supportive care: Managing symptoms and side effects to improve quality of life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Individualized treatment plans should be discussed with healthcare professionals to determine the best approach for each patient.</p>

            <h2>Stages of Care</h2>
            <h3>Early Stage Disease</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the focus is on achieving remission through induction therapy. This is followed by consolidation therapy to eliminate residual disease.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Disease</h3>
            <p>For advanced or relapsed ALL, treatment may involve more intensive chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or a stem cell transplant. The goal is to control the disease, manage symptoms, and improve overall survival.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
            <p>Clinical trials offer access to new and experimental treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Participation in clinical trials can provide additional treatment options and contribute to advancing medical knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>WHO Response</h2>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) works to reduce the global burden of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, through initiatives focused on prevention, early detection, and access to quality treatment. WHO supports countries in implementing strategies such as cancer screening programs, public awareness campaigns, and improving healthcare infrastructure.</p>
            <p>WHO also promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages research and innovation in cancer treatment and care.</p>
