            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide.</li>
                <li>Early detection through screening, such as mammograms, can improve survival rates.</li>
                <li>Risk factors include genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), family history, age, and lifestyle factors.</li>
                <li>Treatment options vary and may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy.</li>
                <li>Breast cancer can also occur in men, although it is much rarer.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. It is a significant health concern for women globally and can also affect men.</p>
            <p>Early detection through regular screening, such as mammograms, can improve the chances of successful treatment and survival. Awareness and education about breast cancer are crucial for early diagnosis and prevention.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of breast cancer can vary but often include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm</li>
                <li>Change in the size, shape, or appearance of the breast</li>
                <li>Dimpling or puckering of the skin on the breast</li>
                <li>Nipple discharge other than breast milk</li>
                <li>Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast</li>
                <li>Pain in the breast or nipple</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you notice any of these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and diagnosis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>While there is no sure way to prevent breast cancer, you can take steps to reduce your risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly</li>
                <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Consider risk-reducing medications or surgery if you have a high risk due to family history or genetic factors</li>
                <li>Get regular screenings and perform self-examinations to detect any changes early</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discussing your risk factors with a healthcare provider can help you determine the best prevention strategies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnostic methods for breast cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mammograms: X-ray images of the breast used to detect abnormalities</li>
                <li>Ultrasound: To further evaluate abnormalities found during a physical exam or mammogram</li>
                <li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): To provide detailed images of the breast</li>
                <li>Biopsy: Taking a sample of tissue from the breast to examine for cancer cells</li>
                <li>Genetic testing: To identify mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tests help confirm the diagnosis and guide the treatment plan.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Treatment and Care</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for breast cancer depend on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the patientâ€™s overall health and preferences. Common treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surgery: Removing the tumor or the entire breast (mastectomy)</li>
                <li>Radiation therapy: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells</li>
                <li>Chemotherapy: Using drugs to kill cancer cells or stop their growth</li>
                <li>Hormone therapy: Blocking hormones that fuel certain types of breast cancer</li>
                <li>Targeted therapy: Using drugs that target specific characteristics of cancer cells</li>
                <li>Immunotherapy: Helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supportive care and rehabilitation are also important for managing side effects and improving quality of life during and after treatment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Stages of Care</h2>
            <h3>Early Stage Disease</h3>
            <p>Treatment for early stage breast cancer may involve surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and radiation therapy. Hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy may also be recommended based on the specific characteristics of the cancer.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Disease</h3>
            <p>For advanced or metastatic breast cancer, treatment aims to control the disease and manage symptoms. Options may include systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as well as localized treatments to manage specific areas affected by the cancer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
            <p>Clinical trials offer access to new and experimental treatments for breast cancer. Participation in clinical trials can provide additional treatment options and contribute to advancing medical knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>WHO Response</h2>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) works to reduce the global burden of cancer, including breast cancer, through initiatives focused on prevention, early detection, and access to quality treatment. WHO supports countries in implementing strategies such as cancer screening programs, public awareness campaigns, and improving healthcare infrastructure.</p>
            <p>WHO also promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages research and innovation in cancer treatment and care.</p>
