        <h1>Prostate Cancer</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men.</li>
                <li>Early-stage prostate cancer usually has no symptoms and is often detected through screening tests.</li>
                <li>Prostate cancer can be slow-growing, and some men may not need treatment right away.</li>
                <li>Screening for prostate cancer includes a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and a digital rectal exam (DRE).</li>
                <li>Treatment options vary and may include active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the prostate gland, which is a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces seminal fluid. It is a significant health concern for men worldwide.</p>
            <p>Many prostate cancers grow slowly and are confined to the prostate gland, where they may not cause serious harm. However, some types are aggressive and can spread quickly.</p>
            <p>Prostate cancer is typically detected through screening tests, which can find the cancer at an early stage when treatment is more effective.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Early-stage prostate cancer often has no symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trouble urinating</li>
                <li>Decreased force in the stream of urine</li>
                <li>Blood in the urine</li>
                <li>Blood in the semen</li>
                <li>Bone pain</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>Erectile dysfunction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>While there is no sure way to prevent prostate cancer, you can reduce your risk by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables</li>
                <li>Exercising regularly</li>
                <li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Discussing your risk factors with a healthcare provider to determine if you should consider prostate cancer screening</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's also important to avoid smoking and to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnostic methods for prostate cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: A blood test that measures the level of PSA in the blood.</li>
                <li>Digital rectal exam (DRE): A physical examination where a doctor feels the prostate gland through the rectum to check for abnormalities.</li>
                <li>Prostate biopsy: Taking a sample of tissue from the prostate to examine under a microscope.</li>
                <li>Imaging tests: Such as ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans to get a detailed view of the prostate and surrounding tissues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tests help determine the presence of cancer, its stage, and the best course of treatment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Treatment and Care</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on the stage of the disease, the patient's overall health, and personal preferences. Common treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Active surveillance: Monitoring the cancer closely and opting for treatment if it shows signs of progression.</li>
                <li>Surgery: Removing the prostate gland (prostatectomy) is a common treatment for early-stage prostate cancer.</li>
                <li>Radiation therapy: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.</li>
                <li>Hormone therapy: Reducing the levels of male hormones that can promote cancer growth.</li>
                <li>Chemotherapy: Using drugs to kill cancer cells, often used when the cancer has spread outside the prostate.</li>
                <li>Targeted therapy: Using drugs that target specific weaknesses in cancer cells.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supportive care, including managing symptoms and providing emotional support, is also crucial for improving the quality of life for patients and their families.</p>

            <h2>Stages of Care</h2>
            <h3>Early Stage Disease</h3>
            <p>Treatment for early stage prostate cancer may involve active surveillance, surgery, or radiation therapy. The choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the patient's age, health status, and preferences.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Disease</h3>
            <p>For advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, treatment aims to control the disease and manage symptoms. Options may include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and newer treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
            <p>Clinical trials offer access to new and experimental treatments for prostate cancer. Participation in clinical trials can provide additional treatment options and contribute to advancing medical knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>WHO Response</h2>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) works to reduce the global burden of cancer, including prostate cancer, through initiatives focused on prevention, early detection, and access to quality treatment. WHO supports countries in implementing strategies such as cancer screening programs, public awareness campaigns, and improving healthcare infrastructure.</p>
            <p>WHO also promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages research and innovation in cancer treatment and care.</p>
