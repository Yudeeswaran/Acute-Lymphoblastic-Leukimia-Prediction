        <section>
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide.</li>
                <li>Early detection through screening, such as colonoscopy, can improve survival rates.</li>
                <li>Risk factors include age, family history, certain genetic syndromes, diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</li>
                <li>Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.</li>
                <li>Both men and women are at risk for colorectal cancer, particularly those over the age of 50.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the colon or rectum. It is also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, depending on where it starts.</p>
            <p>Early detection through regular screening can significantly reduce the risk of dying from colorectal cancer. Awareness and education about the disease are crucial for early diagnosis and prevention.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of colorectal cancer can vary but often include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation</li>
                <li>Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding</li>
                <li>Persistent abdominal discomfort, such as cramps, gas, or pain</li>
                <li>Feeling that the bowel does not empty completely</li>
                <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and diagnosis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>While there is no sure way to prevent colorectal cancer, you can take steps to reduce your risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
                <li>Limit red meat and processed meats</li>
                <li>Exercise regularly</li>
                <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Get regular screenings, such as colonoscopies, starting at age 50 or earlier if you have a family history or other risk factors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discussing your risk factors with a healthcare provider can help you determine the best prevention strategies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnostic methods for colorectal cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Colonoscopy: A procedure to examine the inside of the colon and rectum using a camera</li>
                <li>Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): A test to check for hidden blood in the stool</li>
                <li>Sigmoidoscopy: Similar to a colonoscopy but examines only the rectum and lower colon</li>
                <li>CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy): A CT scan to visualize the colon</li>
                <li>Biopsy: Taking a sample of tissue from the colon or rectum to examine for cancer cells</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tests help confirm the diagnosis and guide the treatment plan.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Treatment and Care</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for colorectal cancer depend on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the patientâ€™s overall health and preferences. Common treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surgery: Removing the tumor and surrounding tissue</li>
                <li>Radiation therapy: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells</li>
                <li>Chemotherapy: Using drugs to kill cancer cells or stop their growth</li>
                <li>Targeted therapy: Using drugs that target specific characteristics of cancer cells</li>
                <li>Immunotherapy: Helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supportive care and rehabilitation are also important for managing side effects and improving quality of life during and after treatment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Stages of Care</h2>
            <h3>Early Stage Disease</h3>
            <p>Treatment for early stage colorectal cancer may involve surgery to remove the tumor, often followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy to eliminate any remaining cancer cells.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Disease</h3>
            <p>For advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment aims to control the disease and manage symptoms. Options may include systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as well as localized treatments to manage specific areas affected by the cancer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
            <p>Clinical trials offer access to new and experimental treatments for colorectal cancer. Participation in clinical trials can provide additional treatment options and contribute to advancing medical knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>WHO Response</h2>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) works to reduce the global burden of cancer, including colorectal cancer, through initiatives focused on prevention, early detection, and access to quality treatment. WHO supports countries in implementing strategies such as cancer screening programs, public awareness campaigns, and improving healthcare infrastructure.</p>
            <p>WHO also promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages research and innovation in cancer treatment and care.</p>
