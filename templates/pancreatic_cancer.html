        <h1>Pancreatic Cancer</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, with a high mortality rate.</li>
                <li>It is often diagnosed at a late stage due to non-specific symptoms.</li>
                <li>Risk factors include smoking, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, family history, and certain genetic mutations.</li>
                <li>Treatment options vary and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.</li>
                <li>Pancreatic cancer has a low 5-year survival rate, highlighting the need for early detection and new treatment strategies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of the pancreas, an organ located behind the lower part of the stomach. It is a highly lethal cancer, often diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited.</p>
            <p>Early detection is challenging due to the lack of specific symptoms in the initial stages of the disease. Awareness and education about pancreatic cancer are crucial for early diagnosis and better outcomes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of pancreatic cancer can vary but often include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdominal pain that radiates to the back</li>
                <li>Loss of appetite or unintended weight loss</li>
                <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
                <li>Light-colored stools</li>
                <li>Dark urine</li>
                <li>Itchy skin</li>
                <li>New diagnosis of diabetes or existing diabetes becoming more difficult to control</li>
                <li>Blood clots</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and diagnosis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>While there is no sure way to prevent pancreatic cancer, you can take steps to reduce your risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid smoking</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
                <li>Exercise regularly</li>
                <li>Limit alcohol consumption</li>
                <li>Manage underlying conditions such as diabetes and chronic pancreatitis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discussing your risk factors with a healthcare provider can help you determine the best prevention strategies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnostic methods for pancreatic cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Imaging tests: CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound to visualize the pancreas</li>
                <li>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): To obtain detailed images and perform a biopsy</li>
                <li>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): To view the pancreatic and bile ducts and take tissue samples</li>
                <li>Biopsy: Taking a sample of tissue from the pancreas to examine for cancer cells</li>
                <li>Blood tests: To measure levels of specific proteins (tumor markers) associated with pancreatic cancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tests help confirm the diagnosis and guide the treatment plan.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Treatment and Care</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for pancreatic cancer depend on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the patientâ€™s overall health and preferences. Common treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surgery: Procedures like the Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue</li>
                <li>Radiation therapy: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells</li>
                <li>Chemotherapy: Using drugs to kill cancer cells or stop their growth</li>
                <li>Targeted therapy: Using drugs that target specific characteristics of cancer cells</li>
                <li>Immunotherapy: Helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells</li>
                <li>Palliative care: To manage symptoms and improve quality of life</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supportive care and rehabilitation are also important for managing side effects and improving quality of life during and after treatment.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Stages of Care</h2>
            <h3>Early Stage Disease</h3>
            <p>Treatment for early stage pancreatic cancer may involve surgery to remove the tumor, often followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy to eliminate any remaining cancer cells.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Disease</h3>
            <p>For advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, treatment aims to control the disease and manage symptoms. Options may include systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as well as localized treatments to manage specific areas affected by the cancer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
            <p>Clinical trials offer access to new and experimental treatments for pancreatic cancer. Participation in clinical trials can provide additional treatment options and contribute to advancing medical knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>WHO Response</h2>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) works to reduce the global burden of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, through initiatives focused on prevention, early detection, and access to quality treatment. WHO supports countries in implementing strategies such as cancer screening programs, public awareness campaigns, and improving healthcare infrastructure.</p>
            <p>WHO also promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages research and innovation in cancer treatment and care.</p>
